# Cypher Space - Secure Messaging Application

Cypher Space is a highly secure messaging exchange application that implements the Vigenere Cipher algorithm for message encryption built on ICP.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages are encrypted using the Vigenere Cipher algorithm, ensuring secure communication between users.

## Security Considerations

- **Vigenere Cipher**: The application uses the Vigenere Cipher algorithm for message encryption. While historically significant, it's important to note that modern cryptographic applications often use more advanced encryption algorithms.

- **Secure Communication**: Despite the use of encryption, it's essential to follow best practices for secure communication, including secure key, and encoding characters exchange and proper handling of encryption keys.
